These are data for the 565 nodes, excluding the ones labeled "none" by the infomap parcellation.  the details are contained in parcelinfo_new_unspaced.txt. which has the following columns:

- node number (indexed from zero)
- original node number (from 634 node graph - also indexed from zero)
- X
- Y
- Z
- hemisphere
- network name
- network number

the nodes are sorted by hemisphere, then by network, then by Y location (i.e. front to back of the brain).  The left hemisphere nodes are reversed in order, so that the order of the nodes in the files follows exactly the order around the circle.
